In a bid to contain the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") across the
country, the National Government was constrained to enforce a massive shutdown of economic
activities, which adversely affected various critical industries, and triggered an economic downturn. Thus,
there is a need for the State to enact measures aimed at supporting industries critical to economic recovery
and maintaining employment levels.
The proposed legislative measure seeks to strengthen the capacity of the following Government
Financial Institutions, namely: the Land Bank of the Philippines ("LBP") and the Development Bank of
the Philippines ("DBP"), in order to provide the needed assistance to micro, small, and medium
enterprises (MSMEs"), and other strategically important companies.

in order to assist affected MSMEs to meet their liquidity needs. In particular, LBP and DBP are mandated
to expand their credit and rediscounting facilities to affected MSMEs in the agriculture, infrastructure,
manufacturing and service industries.
In addition, the proposed bill authorizes LBP and DBP to create a special holding company which
aims to further reinvigorate these strategically important companies heavily affected by the COVID-19
pandemic. Equity participation in this special holding company may be held by qualified private sector
investors. However, to ensure that the policies and objectives under the proposed bill are effectively
carried out, LBP and DBP are mandated to maintain at least a majority ownership over the special holding
company until such time that they have recovered their investment.
The special holding company is intended to be a major player in the financial and capital markets
by providing aid to strategically important companies with solvency/liquidity issues brought about by
COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, the special holding company shall be authorized to invest or
place funds in equity, execute convertible loans or purchase convertible bonds and/or other securities,
in said strategically important companies, as well as to incorporate subsidiaries. Nevertheless, to ensure
that such investments are properly utilized, as well as to ensure the successful rehabilitation of strategically
important companies, the legislative measure imposes restrictions on the investee company by requiring
