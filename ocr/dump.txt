a.
CHAPTER I
GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 1. Short Title. - This Act shall be known as the "Department of OFW Act of 2019."
SECTION 2. Declaration of Policies. -
While recognizing the significant contribution of Filipino migrant workers and overseas
Filipinos to the national economy through their foreign exchange remittances and
investments, the State does not promote overseas employment as a means to sustain
economic growth and achieve national development. The existence of the overseas
employment program rests solely on the assurance that the dignity and fundamental
human rights and freedoms of the Filipino citizens shall not, at any time, be
compromised or violated. The State, therefore, shall continuously create local
employment opportunities and promote the equitable distribution of wealth and the
benefits of development. Toward this end, the State shall continually aim to make
migration a choice and not a necessity for every Filipino worker;
b. In the pursuit of an independent foreign policy and while considering national
sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest, and the right to self-determination
paramount in its relations with other states, the State shall, at all times, uphold the
dignity of its citizens, whether in country or overseas, in general, and Filipino migrant
workers, in particular, continuously monitor international conventions, adopt/be
signatory to and ratify those that guarantee protection to our migrant workers, and
