Securing the pension system for military and uniformed personnel (MUP) is an obligation of the State.
Because of long-standing issues in the design of the system, however, the MUP pension is facing an
imminent existential threat. The possibility that the state will be unable to meet the funding requirements
of the MUP pension is real, and its signs are now evident given the government's budget deficit is at
P187.7 billion pesos.
Such funding requirements will continue to elevate at a fiscally unsustainable rate, as pension payments
are indexed to growing salaries of active MUP. Moreover, the ballooning MUP pension requirements,
with no corresponding financing source cover, create significant fiscal risk to the government and expose
the MUP pension from fiscal and economic shocks. Thus, it is imperative to make crucial changes to
save the pension system.
To keep the pension system alive for current and future pensioners, we must address the system's most
significant weaknesses. First, the pension of the MUP is indexed to the salary of active personnel.
Second, unlike other government employees, the MUP are entitled to a retirement pension starting at
20 years of service before reaching retirement age. Finally, unlike the pension of government employees
under the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the MUP pension is non-contributory.
The urgency of the situation is shown clearly by the size of the problem. The estimated total funding
requirement is around P9.6 trillion if the status quo is maintained, according to the latest actuarial study
by the GSIS.
The size of the problem will continue to expand as we recruit more MUP. The MUP pension is already
nine times that of the average pensioner of the Social Security System (SSS) and three times that of the
average GSIS pensioner.
