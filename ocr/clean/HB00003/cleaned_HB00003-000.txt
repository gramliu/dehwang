The shift to digital platforms has been long time coming. The COVID-19 pandemic only
expedited the need for its execution. The policies in the "new normal" must be responsive to the
needs of the populace and allow them to truly feel a sense of normalcy, rather than burden them
with inevitable but avoidable restrictions. Digitalization of services is evidently the most efficient
solution to the gap in the delivery of government services. It is high time to enact a law that would
require all government agencies to transition to digital platforms.
This bill seeks to establish an integrated, interconnected, and interoperable information,
resource sharing and communications network which shall include internal records, management
information system, information database, and digital portals spanning the entirety of the national
and local government for the delivery of public services.
The proposal will promote the use of the internet, intranet, and emerging technologies within
and across government agencies and be able to provide citizen-centric government information and
services. It likewise pushes for the digitization of paper-based and other traditional modes of
workflows for a more efficient and transparent public service.
Moreover, the bill encourages government cooperation with the private sector in providing
resources, assets, and services, and transforms agency operations by utilizing best practices from
public and private sector organizations, both local and international. It seeks to provide enhanced
access to government information and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding
protection of personal privacy, national security, records retention, access for persons with
disabilities, and other relevant laws.
