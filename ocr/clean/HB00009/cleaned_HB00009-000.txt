This bill seeks to modernize the country's capabilities for public health emergency preparedness
and strengthen the current bureaucracy that is mandated to prevent the spread of communicable diseases
in the country through organizational and institutional reforms.
To better prepare against public health emergencies, the proposed measure seeks to advance two
essential initiatives: health modernization and institutional reforms. The authors acknowledge the need
to modernize and reorganize our health system to protect the public from health risks.
In terms of organizational restructuring, the proposal is for the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
to absorb the following DOH units or their divisions or functions: Epidemiology Bureau; Research
Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM); Sexually Transmitted Disease - Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (STD-AIDS) Cooperative Central Laboratory; Select functions of the International Health
Surveillance Division of the Bureau of Quarantine such as the passive international health surveillance
and development of communication methods for wider and more effective delivery of critical public
health information with international importance; Technical and standard setting functions of the Disease
Prevention and Control Bureau including that of the Mental Health Division, Cancer Division and Oral
Health Division.
Under this bill, the CDC will perform the following powers, functions, and duties: Policy and
Standards Development; Capacity Building and Technical Assistance; Sectoral and Local Engagements:
Surveillance; Technical guidance on the monitoring and evaluation framework for disease prevention and
control; and Certify the existence of an epidemic which shall be treated as a public health emergency,
among other functions as may be mandated by law, or as may be duly delegated by relevant authorities.
It also seeks to establish Regional Centers for Disease Prevention and Control or RCDCs in all regions
of the Philippines.
In terms of modernization, the bill proposes the crafting of modernization program which will
include the acquisition and upgrading of appropriate technologies, laboratories, facilities, equipment,
other needed resources and the needed relocation and acquisition of additional land or location that
would house the CDC.
