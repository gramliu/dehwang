Recognizing the enormous investments that the country needs to put in place if we are to protect
and promote the right of our people to health and ultimately keep them safe from future health threats
and emergencies, the bill proposes that the CDC be mandated to solicit, negotiate with, and receive from
any public or private domestic or foreign sources legacies, gifts, donations, grants, endowments,
contributions or other transfers of ownership and/or possession of real or personal properties of all
kinds, which shall be exempt from donor's tax and shall all be part of the special account in the general
fund managed by the Department of Finance.
Under the bill, Department of Finance shall prescribe the measures necessary for the proper use,
maintenance and safekeeping of said donations, grants, endowments, contributions or transfers and the
compliance of the terms and conditions thereon, if any, in accordance with pertinent accounting and
auditing laws, rules and regulations.
