The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the inability of the Philippines health care system to cope
with the surge of patients needing medical care due to lack of medically-trained personnel.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are six medical doctors per 10,000
population in the Philippines in 2017, the latest data available. This is lower than the recommended ratio
of 10 doctors per 10,000 population (WHO, 2018). Compared to other Southeast Asian countries, the
doctor to population ratio in the country is also lower. Singapore has 23 doctors per 100,000.
Vietnam, Thailand and impoverished Timor Leste have each 8 doctors per 100,000 people. In developed
countries such as Italy and the United States, the doctor-population ratio is 40 and 26 per 10,000
population, respectively.
Currently, the Philippines has a shortage of 290,000 health workers in the country as reported by
the Human Resource for Health Network (HRI IN), an inter-agency policy and program support network
led by the Department of Health (DOH). This is based on the WHO indicative HRH ratio of 44.5 HRH
to 10,000 population for the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Moreover, there is
an annual out migration of 13,000 health care professionals which aggravates the deficiency in the
national supply of health care workers (POFA, 2020).
Against this backdrop, this bill aims to enhance the capacity of our country to produce and call
on the needed manpower and expand its human health resources in times of disasters and public health
emergencies of both national and local scale through the mobilization of medical reserve force
specifically trained to supplement the existing human health resources to ease the burden in our
healthcare system.
As proposed in this bill, the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) shall consist of the following hierarchy
of call whose primary mission is to support the country's public health system in times of public health
