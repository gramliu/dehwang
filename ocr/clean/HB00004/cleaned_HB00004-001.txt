Notably, the Philippines has the lowest GMV in 2019 at $7 billion, lower than Malaysia
($40 billion), this — - despite the Philippines' estimated 76 million active internet users and high internet
penetration rate (71% vis-à-vis 54% global average), longer hours spent daily on the Internet
(10 hours vis-à-vis global average of 6 hours 42 minutes), and very high social media penetration for
population aged 13 and above (99% vis-à-vis a 59% global average).
We acknowledge that the expected growth of the Philippine Internet economy at 27% CAGR is
deemed to be one of the fastest among ASEAN economies. The findings of Google and Temasek, and

Indeed, e-commerce in the country is in its nascent stage, rejecting immense potential for
businesses. The Philippines has not yet generated unicorns - a tech start-up company that reaches a

Vietnamese e-commerce markets have reached at 2.8% and 4.0% of GDP, respectively.
The Philippines' e-commerce market remains at 1.6% of GDP.
Philippine MSMEs lag behind the adoption of e-commerce because enterprises either find
using digital technology platforms and tools too difficult, or are unaware of the benefits they offer.
The Philippines also lacks policies and regulations that will facilitate online transactions and
cross-border trade processes which should address the following concerns:
Internet infrastructure (Low internet speed experienced in Philippines);
Logistics infrastructure (Weak last-mile delivery options; challenging topographical
Payment mechanisms (Payment gateways and currency exchange rates; Majority still
Lack of governing entity at the regional level that can fight Cybercrime and settle
VAT registrations of foreign e-commerce operators, 12% VAT on total value of online
This bill seeks to promote an environment founded on trust among consumers and mercha:
as a means to increase the number of e-commerce participants, and ultimately achieve sustainable
growth. Moreover, this bill will address the need to establish a singular office that will:
(1) be responsible to carry out provisions thereof; (2) ensure the implementation of
Republic Act. No. 8792 or the Electronic E-commerce Act of 2000; and (3) serve as the focal point in
the monitoring and implementation of the Philippine E-commerce Roadmap.
