From mobile shopping to online shopping, electronic e-commerce (e-commerce) has radically
changed the way we live our lives. Whether as a consumer or seller, the Internet has dramatically
transformed the way business is conducted. The rise of digital technology saw the emergence of mobile
networks and rapid advancement in computer applications. Such advancement boosted humanity to
where we are today. As Bill Gates said, "[digital technology is the center of attention for businesses, governments
and individuals around the world. It has spanned entirely new industries, transformed existing ones, and become a global
cultural phenomenon.
From the buyer's perspective, e-commerce is faster, cheaper and more convenient. Consumers
are presented with a variety of options to meet their every need with a tap of a finger. E-Commerce
provides consumers with time-saving options and access to swift delivery of goods and services.
Likewise, it presents value for money largely because from the seller's perspective, set-up costs are
lower and operating costs are kept at a minimum. It has been said that from an enterprise's perspective,
e-commerce is the great equalizer because MSMEs gain access to the same market at low costs.
Furthermore, the importance of e-commerce platforms in the ecosystem has become integral as they
are able to aggregate multiple transactions. They play a key role in balancing the needs of consumers
and sellers by facilitating fair and efficient trade between these two players.
Undeniably, technology has revolutionized our conventional way of buying and selling in ways
unimaginable to those that have come before us.
