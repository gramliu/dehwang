The proposed Internet Transactions Act was approved on Third Reading by the House of
Representatives during the previous Eighteenth (18th) Congress. In refiling the same, we acknowledge
and recognize former Deputy Speaker Wes Gatchalian (First District- Valenzuela City) as the principal
author of the subject measure during the 18th Congress.
In view of the foregoing, the strong support of the Members of the Nineteenth (19th) Congress
is carnestly sought for the approval of this bill.
