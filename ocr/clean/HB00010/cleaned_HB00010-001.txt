health experts, both for present outbreaks as well as for future emerging and re-emerging novel viruses,
drug resistant mutations, and viral threats, including viruses affecting our livestock and plants, not only
for their risks impact to food production and security, biodiversity and human safety, but more
importantly to the modes and extent of virus transmission to humans, with the end in view of effective
preventive response, containment interventions, and cure.
There can be no further argument that our best hope, as that of humankind, for preventing and
treatment of infectious diseases and viral infections in humans, as to plants and animals, come from
vigorous research, and stepping up of scientific frontiers and development breakthroughs in the field of
virology, and application of advancement in technology for maximum gains in the campaign for
sustainable public health response.
These, and the current health crisis and future emerging public health threats are issues that can
only be addressed on sustained basis using science and technology approach, specifically through research
and development (R&D) track. It is therefore imperative that we establish a research institute that is
devoted to the study of viruses, or would advance the field of virology.
The proposed establishment of the Philippine Virology Science and Technology Institute, or
"VIP," is a concrete step and strategic response, not only in our fierce fight against the COVID-19
pandemic, but also in ensuring our public health emergency preparedness and response.
We envisioned the VIP as a premiere research institute in the field of virology, encompassing all
areas in viruses and viral diseases in humans, plants, and animals. It will conduct innovative scientific
research on viral agents with focus on vector reservoir transmission, viral ecology, clinical virology,
pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and host-immune response to viral pathogens, including risk factors for
infection, the natural history of diseases, including clinical presentation and outcomes, prognostic factors
for severe illness, the period of infectivity, modes and extent of virus inter-human transmission, and such
other emerging novel scientific fields in virus research.
The proposed institute may explore other fields, such as enteric infections and respiratory
infections, central nervous system infections, viral infections in the immunocompromised hosts, antiviral
and antimicrobial resistance, viral diversity, plant and animal pathology, plant and animal virus
interactions, and major plant and animal viruses, including the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and
therapeutics. The institute will likewise be the knowledge venue for scientists, research institutes and
science-based organizations, both here and abroad, to work collaboratively to study viruses of
agricultural, industrial, clinical, and environmental importance.
This bill, however, highlights the fact that globalization has become a defining term in the 21st
century, and with almost anyone being able to set foot at any place in the world any time, thus diseases,
viruses, and bacteria have the exponential potential as well to travel anywhere.
