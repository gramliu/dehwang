As of this date, the country and the rest of the world are still reeling under the effect and impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with its variants, some of which may be even deadlier and easier to
transmit. The continuing acceleration of globalization will continue to spread virus infections and their
variants at an accelerated scale too. Hence, the growing significance of the immediate establishment of a
virology institute that shall focus on key development areas for virology science and technology
applications in humans, plants, and animals.
These are issues that can only be addressed using science and technology, specifically through
research and development (R&D). It is therefore imperative that we establish a Virology Research
Institute that delves into the study of viruses or the field of virology. The country needs diagnostics to
detect and limit the spread of the existing viruses; vaccines to provide long-term protection; treatments
to save lives in the shorter-term, and social science to understand their behavioral and societal
implications.
With the lessons painfully drawn from this COVID 19 pandemic experience, the time is here and
now to invest decisively in science and technology, if only to ensure our health security and economic
progress from amidst future threats of outbreaks of such magnitude, or even beyond, as the COVID-19
pandemic. Hence, this proposed measure.
We recognize Reps. Joey Sarte Salceda, Cheryl P. Deloso-Montalla, Angelina "Helen"
D.L. Tan, M.D., Strike B. Revilla, Angelo Marcos B. Barba, Leonardo L. Babasa, Ron P. Salo, Luis
Raymund "LRay" F. Villafuerte, Rufus B. Rodriguez and Joaquin M. Chipeco Jr. as authors of this bill.
It was subsequently passed on Third Reading by the House and transmitted to the Senate.
The passage of this bill is most earnestly sought.
