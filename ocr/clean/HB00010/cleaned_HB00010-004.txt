SEC. 5. Creation of the Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines. - The
Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines (VIP)is hereby created and shall be an
attached agency under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) for purposes of policy
and program coordination to ensure alignment in national policies and priorities.
The VIP shall serve as the premier research and development institute in the field of virology,
encompassing all kinds of viruses and viral diseases in plants, animals and humans. It shall be a venue
for scientists, research institutes and other organizations in the Philippines and abroad, to work
collaboratively to study viruses of agricultural, industrial, clinical, and environmental importance.
SEC. 6. Mandate. â€“ The VIP shall implement policies, plans, programs, and projects for the
development of virology science and technology in the country and the promotion of scientific and
