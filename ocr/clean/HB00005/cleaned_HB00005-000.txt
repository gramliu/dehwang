Section 9, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution mandates the State to "undertake, in cooperation
with the public sector, a continuing program of urban land reform and housing which will make available at
affordable cost decent housing and basic services to underprivileged and homeless citizens in urban centers
and resettlements areas. It shall also promote adequate employment opportunities to such citizens."
Section 10 further provides that "No resettlement of urban or rural dwellers shall be undertaken without
adequate consultation with them and the communities where they are to be relocated."
Section 26 of Republic Act No. 7279 states that "On-site development shall be implemented
whenever possible in order to ensure minimum movement of occupants of blighted lands and slum areas.
The resettlement of the beneficiaries of the Program from their existing places of occupancy shall be
undertaken only when on-site development is not feasible and after compliance with the procedures laid
While the government has been providing resettlement sites to informal settler families,
these resettlement sites have mostly been off-city. These are sites that do not provide employment
opportunities and livelihood, as well as social services. As a result, many families are drawn back to the cities
to find employment that would provide for their needs, and end up living again in informal settlements which
are the embodiment of abject poverty, social exclusion, and unsafe housing.
This bill seeks to address the issue by institutionalizing inclusive growth through a local g
unit led on-site, in-city, near-city, or off-city resettlement program which recognizes the people's right to the
city where off-city resettlement shall only be resorted to when near-city resettlement is not feasible and must
satisfy the requirements of adequate and responsive consultation prior to relocation. The bill also provides
for social preparation activities for beneficiaries and the institutionalization of a people's plan developed by
the beneficiaries in coordination with the implementing local government unit.
