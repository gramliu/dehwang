This bill was approved by the Committee on Justice in the 18th Congress. It is the consolidated version of
various bills filed by Reps. Arnie B. Fuentebella, Joel Mayo Z. Almario, Alfred Vargas, Ferdinand L. Hernandez,
Eric L. Olivarez, Eric Go Yap, Joy Myra Tambunting, Paolo Z. Duterte, Divina Grace C. Yu, and Michael Odylon
I.. Romero.
The purpose of this bill is to provide free legal assistance to military and uniformed personnel (MUPs)
who have pending cases before the prosecutor's office, the courts, or any quasi-judicial or administrative body
involving service-related incidents. Originally, the proposal was to grant free legal assistance to officers and
uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP).
During the deliberations of the Committee on Justice, however, it was deemed necessary to include officers and
uniformed personnel of the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP)
and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), since they are also included in the definition of "military and uniformed
personnel" under existing laws. Hence, this bill will provide free legal assistance to all officers or uniformed
personnel of the AFP, PNP, BJMP, BFP and PCG in all stages of criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings
arising from service-related incidents, including retired MUPs who had cases or charges involving service-related
incidents while still in active duty.
By providing free legal assistance under this measure, our MUPs who sacrifice their life and limb for the
preservation of our national security, public order and public safety will be able to perform their sworn duties
without fear of unwarranted cases filed against them for the purpose of harassment or reprisal.
In view of the foregoing, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought.
