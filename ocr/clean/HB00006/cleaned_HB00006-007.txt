being maximized by the user thereof, or that the grantee has violated the provisions of this Act, it may,
motu proprio or upon petition by any person, subject to due process, recall the radio spectrum

spectrum resources which promote, establish, or perpetuate the significant market power of PTEs or
of only a limited number of participants. In instances where the resulting assignment of spectrum for
mobile and point-to-multipoint networks will give an assignee or entities it controls, jointly or singly,

requests by that party or its affiliates, fifteen percent (15%) or above of assignable spectrum in the

required to serve notice to the PCC and secure a no-objection notice from the PCC. The PCC shall
issue a no-objection notice within thirty (30) working days upon its receipt of pertinent information
necessary for the review and issuance of the notice: Provided, That the PCC may once extend such
period for an additional fifteen (15) working days upon their notification of the NTC and the
