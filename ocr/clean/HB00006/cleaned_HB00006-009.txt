1 effectivity of this Act, the PCC and the NTC shall enter into an agreement to foster and develop
2 interagency cooperation mechanisms, including information-sharing tools, that will guide them in the
3 performance of their respective mandates, and in the promotion of fair competition in the data
transmission industry.
SEC. 11. Technological Neutrality. The NTC shall ensure that the provisions of this Act
apply, mutatis mutandis, to future technologies in data transmission.
SEC. 12. Infrastructure Sharing and Co-location. - The DICT and the NTC shall
promulgate policies, rules, and regulations to ensure that passive infrastructure, whether existing or
built in the future, necessary or capable of supporting data transmission networks or services are:
(a) made mandatory for open access and made available for co-location and co-use by the
owner of network facilities, equipment, and infrastructure on an open, fair, and
12 nondiscriminatory basis to any access seeker's network facilities, in any segment, subject to the
13 technical feasibility of the access seeker's request and the network facility and infrastructure owner's
standard published offer terms, conditions, and rates: Provided, That the provision of access to
government-owned and operated facilities and support infrastructure to access seekers for the
purpose of offering data transmission services shall be mandatory, unless special circumstances, such
(b) built not only in the city centers, but most especially in the remote, unserved, and
underserved areas in order to extend data transmission services by both the existing and new players
(c) as far as possible, deployed together with roadworks, pipe-laying, and other infrastructure
(d) proliferated in the most cost-efficient and timely manner through various means, including,
encouraging the operation of independent entities that build and operate towers, dark fiber, and utility
corridors, among other passive infrastructure that help facilitate data transmission network
deployment.
The DICT shall coordinate and issue a policy with other relevant government agencies upon
consultation with stakeholders to implement this provision. For purposes of data transmission, the
NTC shall, in case of a dispute arising from an infrastructure sharing agreement: (1) mediate between
a data transmission industry participant and an infrastructure owner, and (2) serve as the primary
enforcer of this provision.
The DICT and the NTC shall promulgate policies, rules, and regulations to ensure that
buildings, condominiums, villages, towns, and subdivisions are all built with facilities, such as cable
entrances, ducts, and risers, that allow nondiscriminatory access to multiple data transmission industry
players in order for them to provide service. They shall also promulgate policies, rules, and guidelines
that will ensure a level-playing field and price nondiscrimination among data transmission industry
participants and network facility and infrastructure owners.
