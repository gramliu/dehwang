In today's day and age, the world grows more and more dependent on information and
communications technology (ICT) related services like the internet. Unfortunately, it is no secret that our
country suffers from slow internet speeds. Compounded by the fact that aside from its snail-paced speeds,
the Philippines is among the costliest in the world.
Underdeveloped ICT infrastructure coupled with the growing demand for more data and higher
bandwidth result in inefficient services that cost people's time and money. In the latest ranking made by
the World Economic Forum the Philippines shows the significant drop of position and among the factors
linked to this is the supposedly poor competitiveness of the country's ICT infrastructures.
This bill seeks to lay the foundation of a framework that will promulgate rules and standards to
promote the construction and development of reliable, affordable, open and accessible data networks that
transmit information at speed and quality comparable to the best in the world.
Likewise, the bill proposes to establish a strong and independent regulatory system and body to
create an environment within the data transmission industry that is conducive to open, fair and
innovation-propelled competition and shall encourage investments in the development of digital
infrastructure of the country. Moreover, the proposed bill mandates interconnection among data
transmission participants to avoid dominance by a single player or by a group of data providers.
Further, the bill clarifies the role of the National Telecommunications Commission to maximize
the utilization of radio spectrum resources in the allocation and assignment of such finite resources in the
transmission of data, by ensuring that spectrum is made available for the use of all registered data
transmission industry participants and gives NTC additional power to promote a more conducive
environment for data networks.
