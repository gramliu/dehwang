Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Congress assembled: To protect the military and uniformed personnel against the extraordinary hazards, risks, and dangers that they encounter in the performance of their duties, the State shall ensure that 12 there shall be an adequate, robust, and a well-managed insurance system that shall adequately and 13 sustainably support their needs and that of their dependents. SEC. 2. Declaration of Policy. - The State duly recognizes the vital role of the military and uniformed personnel in providing internal and external security, promoting peace and order, and ensuring public safety. The State also recognizes its obligation to secure the pension system for the military and uniformed personnel given the distinctive personal risks in their role in nation building and national security. Towards these ends, the State shall guarantee the sustainability of the pension and other benefits of the military and uniformed personnel by creating a fiscal framework that fully supports their funding requirements
Securing the pension system for military and uniformed personnel (MUP) is an obligation of the State. Because of long-standing issues in the design of the system, however, the MUP pension is facing an imminent existential threat. The possibility that the state will be unable to meet the funding requirements of the MUP pension is real, and its signs are now evident given the government's budget deficit is at P187.7 billion pesos. Such funding requirements will continue to elevate at a fiscally unsustainable rate, as pension payments are indexed to growing salaries of active MUP. Moreover, the ballooning MUP pension requirements, with no corresponding financing source cover, create significant fiscal risk to the government and expose the MUP pension from fiscal and economic shocks. Thus, it is imperative to make crucial changes to save the pension system. To keep the pension system alive for current and future pensioners, we must address the system's most significant weaknesses. First, the pension of the MUP is indexed to the salary of active personnel. Second, unlike other government employees, the MUP are entitled to a retirement pension starting at 20 years of service before reaching retirement age. Finally, unlike the pension of government employees under the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the MUP pension is non-contributory. The urgency of the situation is shown clearly by the size of the problem. The estimated total funding requirement is around P9.6 trillion if the status quo is maintained, according to the latest actuarial study by the GSIS. The size of the problem will continue to expand as we recruit more MUP. The MUP pension is already nine times that of the average pensioner of the Social Security System (SSS) and three times that of the average GSIS pensioner
To address this staggering fiscal overhang, this bill, patterned after the Committee Report of the Adhoc Committee on the MUP Pension System of the 18th Congress chaired by Representative Joey Sarte (1) Monthly disability pension. Grants a monthly disability pension, in lieu of disability benefits provided under existing laws, with the range of rates increased to between P5,000.00 to (2) Mandatory contributions: (i) first three years: 5% employee share, 16% National Government (NG) share; (ii) next three years: 7% employee share, 14% NG share; and (iii) thereafter: 9% employee share, 12% NG share. The NG share shall be used exclusively for pensions while the MUP's monthly contribution shall go to the MUP Trust Fund, 45% of which is for the establishment of a life insurance plan with death, accident, and disability benefits; another 45% for the establishment of the Provident Fund; while the remaining 10% is for the payment of (3) Fund administrator of MUP pension. The MUP Trust Fund Committee will be established as the administrator of the MUP Trust Fund, with the Bureau of Treasury (BTr) as the Secretariat (4) Pension indexation. Limits the automatic indexation of pension and survivorship benefits to adjustments in the salary of those in the active service holding the same rank, with a five percent (5%) annual cap on the salary increase of MUP for the next ten (10) years following the effectivity of the measure. The bill also allows the President, upon recommendation to the MUP Trust Fund Committee, to increase pensions at a rate lower than the growth rate in salaries, when the national (5) Other sources of funding.

In today's day and age, the world grows more and more dependent on information and communications technology (ICT) related services like the internet. Unfortunately, it is no secret that our country suffers from slow internet speeds. Compounded by the fact that aside from its snail-paced speeds, the Philippines is among the costliest in the world. Underdeveloped ICT infrastructure coupled with the growing demand for more data and higher bandwidth result in inefficient services that cost people's time and money. In the latest ranking made by the World Economic Forum the Philippines shows the significant drop of position and among the factors linked to this is the supposedly poor competitiveness of the country's ICT infrastructures. This bill seeks to lay the foundation of a framework that will promulgate rules and standards to promote the construction and development of reliable, affordable, open and accessible data networks that transmit information at speed and quality comparable to the best in the world. Likewise, the bill proposes to establish a strong and independent regulatory system and body to create an environment within the data transmission industry that is conducive to open, fair and innovation-propelled competition and shall encourage investments in the development of digital infrastructure of the country. Moreover, the proposed bill mandates interconnection among data transmission participants to avoid dominance by a single player or by a group of data providers. Further, the bill clarifies the role of the National Telecommunications Commission to maximize the utilization of radio spectrum resources in the allocation and assignment of such finite resources in the transmission of data, by ensuring that spectrum is made available for the use of all registered data transmission industry participants and gives NTC additional power to promote a more conducive environment for data networks

This bill was approved by the Committee on Justice in the 18th Congress. It is the consolidated version of various bills filed by Reps. Arnie B. Fuentebella, Joel Mayo Z. Almario, Alfred Vargas, Ferdinand L. Hernandez, Eric L. Olivarez, Eric Go Yap, Joy Myra Tambunting, Paolo Z. Duterte, Divina Grace C. Yu, and Michael Odylon I.. Romero. The purpose of this bill is to provide free legal assistance to military and uniformed personnel (MUPs) who have pending cases before the prosecutor's office, the courts, or any quasi-judicial or administrative body involving service-related incidents. Originally, the proposal was to grant free legal assistance to officers and uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP). During the deliberations of the Committee on Justice, however, it was deemed necessary to include officers and uniformed personnel of the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), since they are also included in the definition of ""military and uniformed personnel"" under existing laws. Hence, this bill will provide free legal assistance to all officers or uniformed personnel of the AFP, PNP, BJMP, BFP and PCG in all stages of criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings arising from service-related incidents, including retired MUPs who had cases or charges involving service-related incidents while still in active duty. By providing free legal assistance under this measure, our MUPs who sacrifice their life and limb for the preservation of our national security, public order and public safety will be able to perform their sworn duties without fear of unwarranted cases filed against them for the purpose of harassment or reprisal.

From mobile shopping to online shopping, electronic e-commerce (e-commerce) has radically changed the way we live our lives. Whether as a consumer or seller, the Internet has dramatically transformed the way business is conducted. The rise of digital technology saw the emergence of mobile networks and rapid advancement in computer applications. Such advancement boosted humanity to where we are today. As Bill Gates said, ""[digital technology is the center of attention for businesses, governments and individuals around the world. It has spanned entirely new industries, transformed existing ones, and become a global cultural phenomenon. From the buyer's perspective, e-commerce is faster, cheaper and more convenient. Consumers are presented with a variety of options to meet their every need with a tap of a finger. E-Commerce provides consumers with time-saving options and access to swift delivery of goods and services. Likewise, it presents value for money largely because from the seller's perspective, set-up costs are lower and operating costs are kept at a minimum. It has been said that from an enterprise's perspective, e-commerce is the great equalizer because MSMEs gain access to the same market at low costs. Furthermore, the importance of e-commerce platforms in the ecosystem has become integral as they are able to aggregate multiple transactions. They play a key role in balancing the needs of consumers and sellers by facilitating fair and efficient trade between these two players. Undeniably, technology has revolutionized our conventional way of buying and selling in ways unimaginable to those that have come before us. Based on a recent 2019 study by Google and Temasck, in ASEAN alone, the Internet economy is experiencing exponential growth as total Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) In Southeast Asia has reached the $100 billion mark, and is projected to reach $300 billion in 2025. ASEAN economies have witnessed huge increases in the Internet economy from 2015 to 2019, and growth rate is expected to continue at 10%-30% from 2019 to 2025

To encourage the formation of business enterprises, the growth and integrated development of the eCommerce market, and protection of online consumers, all individuals engaged in eCommerce shall register as a business either as a sole proprietor, one-person corporation, partnership, corporation, or cooperatives.

Notably, the Philippines has the lowest GMV in 2019 at $7 billion, lower than Malaysia ($40 billion), this — - despite the Philippines' estimated 76 million active internet users and high internet penetration rate (71% vis-à-vis 54% global average), longer hours spent daily on the Internet (10 hours vis-à-vis global average of 6 hours 42 minutes), and very high social media penetration for population aged 13 and above (99% vis-à-vis a 59% global average). We acknowledge that the expected growth of the Philippine Internet economy at 27% CAGR is deemed to be one of the fastest among ASEAN economies. The findings of Google and Temasek, and the aim of this bill is to ensure that this growth is achieved or even surpassed. Indeed, e-commerce in the country is in its nascent stage, rejecting immense potential for businesses. The Philippines has not yet generated unicorns - a tech start-up company that reaches a valuation of $1 billion - nor has our economy reflected the dynamism that the Indonesian and Vietnamese e-commerce markets have reached at 2.8% and 4.0% of GDP, respectively. The Philippines' e-commerce market remains at 1.6% of GDP. Philippine MSMEs lag behind the adoption of e-commerce because enterprises either find using digital technology platforms and tools too difficult, or are unaware of the benefits they offer. The Philippines also lacks policies and regulations that will facilitate online transactions and cross-border trade processes which should address the following concerns: Internet infrastructure (Low internet speed experienced in Philippines); Logistics infrastructure (Weak last-mile delivery options; challenging topographical Payment mechanisms (Payment gateways and currency exchange rates; Majority still Lack of governing entity at the regional level that can fight Cybercrime and settle VAT registrations of foreign e-commerce operators, 12% VAT on total value of online This bill seeks to promote an environment founded on trust among consumers and mercha: as a means to increase the number of e-commerce participants, and ultimately achieve sustainable growth.

No. 8792 or the Electronic E-commerce Act of 2000; and (3) serve as the focal point in the monitoring and implementation of the Philippine E-commerce Roadmap

Section 9, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution mandates the State to ""undertake, in cooperation with the public sector, a continuing program of urban land reform and housing which will make available at affordable cost decent housing and basic services to underprivileged and homeless citizens in urban centers and resettlements areas. It shall also promote adequate employment opportunities to such citizens."" Section 10 further provides that ""No resettlement of urban or rural dwellers shall be undertaken without adequate consultation with them and the communities where they are to be relocated.""

health experts, both for present outbreaks as well as for future emerging and re-emerging novel viruses, drug resistant mutations, and viral threats, including viruses affecting our livestock and plants, not only for their risks impact to food production and security, biodiversity and human safety, but more importantly to the modes and extent of virus transmission to humans, with the end in view of effective preventive response, containment interventions, and cure. There can be no further argument that our best hope, as that of humankind, for preventing and treatment of infectious diseases and viral infections in humans, as to plants and animals, come from vigorous research, and stepping up of scientific frontiers and development breakthroughs in the field of virology, and application of advancement in technology for maximum gains in the campaign for sustainable public health response. These, and the current health crisis and future emerging public health threats are issues that can only be addressed on sustained basis using science and technology approach, specifically through research and development (R&D) track. It is therefore imperative that we establish a research institute that is devoted to the study of viruses, or would advance the field of virology. The proposed establishment of the Philippine Virology Science and Technology Institute, or ""VIP,"" is a concrete step and strategic response, not only in our fierce fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in ensuring our public health emergency preparedness and response. We envisioned the VIP as a premiere research institute in the field of virology, encompassing all areas in viruses and viral diseases in humans, plants, and animals. It will conduct innovative scientific research on viral agents with focus on vector reservoir transmission, viral ecology, clinical virology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and host-immune response to viral pathogens, including risk factors for infection, the natural history of diseases, including clinical presentation and outcomes, prognostic factors for severe illness, the period of infectivity, modes and extent of virus inter-human transmission, and such other emerging novel scientific fields in virus research. The proposed institute may explore other fields, such as enteric infections and respiratory infections, central nervous system infections, viral infections in the immunocompromised hosts, antiviral and antimicrobial resistance, viral diversity, plant and animal pathology, plant and animal virus interactions, and major plant and animal viruses, including the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. The institute will likewise be the knowledge venue for scientists, research institutes and science-based organizations, both here and abroad, to work collaboratively to study viruses of agricultural, industrial, clinical, and environmental importance. This bill, however, highlights the fact that globalization has become a defining term in the 21st century, and with almost anyone being able to set foot at any place in the world any time, thus diseases, viruses, and bacteria have the exponential potential as well to travel anywhere
The world has never experienced a prolonged period of uncertainty, devastation, and helplessness unequal in magnitude as that caused by the COVID-19 virus pandemic. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), or COVID 19, has caught the world unprepared, spreading exponentially, afflicted countless lives in all corners of the globe, caused nations untold sufferings, and brought irreversible huge economic collapse to even the world's best economies. This current health crisis in addressing the COVID 19 pandemic phenomenon unequivocally demonstrated the rapidity with which new viruses and their variants can travel across the globe, inflict misery, wrought havoc to human lives, and put the global economy to a halt as nations all but fall helpless amidst specter of their virulence, more transmissible and fatal emerging variants, and threats of resurgence. Almost three years into the unabetted onslaught track of the COVID-19 pandemic, now considered the greatest public health challenge in the current millennium, highlighted the unpreparedness of the country in containing a highly contagious virus and in effectively protecting the public from the health dangers presented by this viral disease yet of unknown origin, still of elusive cure, and of undetermined timetable of total COVID 19 eradication and return to pre-pandemic normalcy. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, however, pointed to many other contingent urgent concerns, including the imperatives to benceforth take serious stock not only of our public health management system and clinical health care capacity, but more so of the competent knowledge, research, and scientific technology application on the immediate containment of the virus transmission and its behavior by ou
As of this date, the country and the rest of the world are still reeling under the effect and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with its variants, some of which may be even deadlier and easier to transmit. The continuing acceleration of globalization will continue to spread virus infections and their variants at an accelerated scale too. Hence, the growing significance of the immediate establishment of a virology institute that shall focus on key development areas for virology science and technology applications in humans, plants, and animals. These are issues that can only be addressed using science and technology, specifically through research and development (R&D). It is therefore imperative that we establish a Virology Research Institute that delves into the study of viruses or the field of virology. The country needs diagnostics to detect and limit the spread of the existing viruses; vaccines to provide long-term protection; treatments to save lives in the shorter-term, and social science to understand their behavioral and societal implications. With the lessons painfully drawn from this COVID 19 pandemic experience, the time is here and now to invest decisively in science and technology, if only to ensure our health security and economic progress from amidst future threats of outbreaks of such magnitude, or even beyond, as the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this proposed measure. We recognize Reps. Joey Sarte Salceda, Cheryl P. Deloso-Montalla, Angelina ""Helen"" D.L. Tan, M.D., Strike B. Revilla, Angelo Marcos B. Barba, Leonardo L. Babasa, Ron P. Salo, Luis Raymund ""LRay"" F. Villafuerte, Rufus B. Rodriguez and Joaquin M. Chipeco Jr. as authors of this bill. It was subsequently passed on Third Reading by the House and transmitted to the Senate. The passage of this bill is most earnestly sought
