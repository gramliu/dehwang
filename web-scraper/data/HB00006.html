      innovation-propelled competition; Mandates interconnection among data
      transmission participants to avoid dominance by a single player or by a
      group of data providers; Intends to clarify the role of the National
      Telecommunications Commission to maximize the utilization of radio
      spectrum resources in the allocation and assignments of finite resources
      in the transmission of data; Provides NTC additional power to promote a
      more conducive environment for data networks.
